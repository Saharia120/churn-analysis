Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory analysis of customer churn to understand the factors that influence whether customers stay with a service or leave. The goal of this analysis is to identify meaningful patterns within the dataset and highlight insights that can help improve customer retention strategies.

The notebook walks through data preparation, feature exploration, and visual analysis. Instead of focusing on predictive modeling, this project emphasizes understanding the relationships between customer demographics, service usage patterns, and churn behavior.

📌 Key Highlights of the Analysis

Examination of overall churn distribution

Breakdown of churn by demographic groups

Comparison of churn rates across service types and contract categories

Analysis of financial attributes such as monthly charges and tenure

Clear visual summaries to support each finding

The visualizations are intentionally simple and easy to interpret, making the analysis approachable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

🧰 Tools and Technologies

Python for data manipulation

Pandas for cleaning and structuring the dataset

Matplotlib for customized visualizations

Jupyter Notebook as the main environment for the analysis

📖 Summary

This project demonstrates practical exploratory data analysis skills by turning raw data into meaningful insights. It can serve as a reference for anyone studying churn behavior, learning EDA techniques, or reviewing data analysis examples. The workflow reflects a real-world approach: start with understanding the data, explore key variables, and use visual evidence to support conclusions.
